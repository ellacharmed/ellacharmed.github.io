# Ella Sahnan

## Hello, world.

I'm Ella (aka Wati).

I'm a note-taker and I like to solve problems. 
I take notes on everything and have always documented things. 

Since I could remember, I've always like puzzles and games that include some logic element to them. I always gravitate towards the technical support side of things in any community I'm a part of. I guess it is the natural Educator in me.

It seems natural to me that I'm in the Data world. But circumstances has not been kind. So, here I am starting over and learning everything Data since 2017. Since I've become more engaged in my learning and in the communities, my learning has skyrocketed in these last 2 years (from mid-2022). I've completed **Machine Learning** courses, **Deep Learning** courses and now learning **Data Engineering**. I have also a couple projects under my belt. Check them out!

Although a few of them is not Data-related, it just goes to show I can learn **anything**!
